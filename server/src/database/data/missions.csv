Clash Of Patrols,"Your forces have been dispatched to a crash site in search of vital intelligence stored in surviving data-cores in the wreckage. High command insists you do not return empty-handed, but warns of enemies converging on the crash site. Secure the area, and the data, at all costs."
Archeotech Recovery,"Your forces are moving to retrieve valuable archeotech. Augur readings indicate the artefacts power cells are being irradiated by battlefield emissions. If they succumb, you will be left with mere shards of scrap. Secure and extract any active archeotech, before it degrades."
Foreward Outpost,"Our observation post has spotted a similar enemy station within striking distance, likely filled with comms augurs that we can sabotage. Take a small force under the cover of darkness and cripple the outpost. But beware, the enemy have likely spotted us in return."
Scorched Earth,"The time for a decisive strike against the foe is nigh. Key targets have been identified and their continued existence can no longer be tolerated. Spread ruination throughout the enemy territory and leave nothing but heaped corpses and blazing wreckage in your wake!"
Sweeping Raid,"Grinding stalemate has paralysed the battle lines, but a decisive blow can lance through the enemy defences. Drive a spearhead through this area, clearing enemy objectives of resistance as you push forwards, but do not allow the enemy to encircle us and cut off our supply lines."
Display Of Might,"Glorious victory in battle is a demonstration of our superiority, and the weakness of our foes. Such an opportunity has arisen. Wrest control of the enemy symbolic sites of resistance and we can crush their fighting spirit â€“ but beware the foes spiteful resilience on the back foot."
