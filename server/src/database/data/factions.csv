Space Wolves,"Every warrior who follows Battle Leader Thoryk into war was hand-chosen by him for their ferocity, suicidal courage and hunterâ€™s instincts. These sons of Russ have battled together on many alien worlds, stalking enemy champions and war leaders like prey before descending upon them in a howling pack to tear their luckless quarry apart.","Thoryk's Void Hunters"
Tyranids,"Categorised an alpha-class threat by Imperial cryptosavants after a series of brutal battles along the Vardenghast Line, this swarm of Tyranid warrior organisms has reaped a bloody toll of Human prey. Flowing into the fight like a single, many-bodied entity, these vicious aliens swiftly close the distance to their enemies before riddling them with gruesome bio-ammunition or tearing them limb from limb.",Vardenghast Swarm
